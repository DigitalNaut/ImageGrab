Pending patchwork:
------------------------------------
eslint.config.js:
  Problem: ESLint doesn't follow its own rules.
  Description: ESLint is ignoring the 'ignores' key and parsing everything inside the 'dist' folder. 
  Workaround: Added the subdirectory to the PNPM script instead as a cli argument.
  To do: Remove the cli argument and let ESLint manage everything from the config file. The final result should be: `lint: "eslint ."`

vite.config.ts timestamp files:
  Problem: Some files are being generated and being left behind.
  Description: The files are created when parsing the Vite config and polluting the base directory if not watched.
  Workaround: None yet, but planning on adding a del-cli command to get rid of them.
  To do: Implement the workaround and wait for the fixes to arrive.

Pending research:
------------------------------------
Shadow DOM:
  Problem: Some SVG elements have a shadow DOM that holds the image data that can't be readily accessed.
  Description: Can't node traverse an element with a shadow DOM, so extra steps are necessary to get the image data elements from the inline SVG.
  Workaround: None yet.
  To do: Implement the workaround and wait for the fixes to arrive.
